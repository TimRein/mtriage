# Back into it
Mtriage development has been stalled for some time, as I've had other
priorities. I'm hoping to pick up the pace in the last couple of months of
2020, however. These are a couple of things on the near horizon:

### Component-wise testing
This is pretty key to ensure that community component contributions are
meaningful. Currently there are only tests for the core part of mtriage, and it
is just an article of faith that each component (selector/analyser) works.

### Custom classifier documentation and compatibility
None of our code for bootstrapping custom classifiers with mtriage is public,
which means that it's pretty much useless to everyone in its current state,
except as a reference. We're looking to drive some more research around
training vision classifiers using synthetic data with mtriage, and we'll fold
out all of these fixes into upstream mtriage as ways to apply custom
classifiers in the abstract via mtriage as a deployment framework.

### Spec-ing a rewrite in Rust/Firecracker
This is somewhat irresponsible on my part, as this here Python/Docker version
of the framework barely works. But I'm looking for a way to get my fingers
properly sticky with Rust in practice, and mtriage seems a good candidate
(systems software, containers, etc).
